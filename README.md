# PHYS 275 - Scientific Computing, Spring 2023

This is all of my code from my Scientific Computing class. See the assignments folder for the cool simulations. 

The coolest things I learned in this class are:
- How to solve partial differential equations
- Monte Carlo methods
- Nice complex data visualization

Make sure to check out Project 2 coupled oscillators and 2D heat equation.


Matlab is nice and all, but boy some things are soo not developer friendly. It's not your go to programmer's language/environment.
